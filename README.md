# Rust at Full Speed: Harnessing Concurrency with Confidence

Welcome to the Rust at Full Speed: Harnessing Concurrency with Confidence training event! We designed this training event to help attendees learn more about concurrent programming with Rust! Concurrent is programming is one of the primary features that makes programming with Rust awesome!

## Getting Started

To code along with the instructor, create a fork of this repository, then create a GitHub Codespace on the fork. The `Fork` button is in the upper-right-hand corner of this page. Once forked, create the green `Code` button on your forked version to access the ability to create a Codespace.

GitHub provides a generous amount of free time for Codespaces each month (currently, 120 hours). You are responsible for any charges incurred if you exceed the free time. You can monitor your usage in the GitHub settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the course, if you run into setup problems, it will not be possible to provide individual support. If you have trouble setting up a local environment, we recommend using Codespaces. If you cannot set up a programming environment, please watch the class, and you can code along with the class recording later.

## Courseware

Code example are located in the `projects` folder. Data files are located in the `projects/data` folder. There are some summary documents in the `projects/docs` folder. Here is a link to the summary documents: [Summary Documents](./projects/docs/README.md)

The programming code authored by the instructor in this repository is made available under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
